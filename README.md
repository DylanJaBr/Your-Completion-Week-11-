Task 1: Dylan

My screen may be smaller but for me to complete this task I had to make "float clampedY = Mathf.Clamp(transform.position.y, -8.5f, 0);" to "float clampedY = Mathf.Clamp(transform.position.y, -4f, 0);". Change -8.5 to -4.

Task 2: Dylan

I added a cylinder that move diagonal from the right side of the screen.
